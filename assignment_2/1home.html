                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Yoonhee Kim, but I usually go by Yoonie or Yoon.
                        I am a student of Computer Programming and Analysis at George Brown College.
                        I am from South Korea, had studied Architectural design for 5 years in Korea but
                        I wanted to learn something new and it also had to have an exact answer than 
                        an abstract and vague thing. I look forward to a new attempt by combining the
                        architectural knowledge I have and technical skill I will learn from now on.
                        I will enjoy this challenge in my life and try to gain valuable skills and knowledge throughout this course.</p>
